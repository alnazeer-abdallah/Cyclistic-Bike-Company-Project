# Cyclistic Bike Company Project

----------------
## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Cyclistic rides, focusing on the differences between casual and member riders and identifying strategies to increase member ridership.

## Dataset
The dataset consisted of several tables representing Cyclistic rides, including ride_id, rideable_type, date, location, and rider type.

## Data Cleaning and Manipulation
Duplicate values were removed from all tables using their ride_id. Ride length and the day of the week that each ride started were calculated.

## Data Analysis and Result

1.	Casual riders tend to ride for longer durations than members.
2.	Casual rider usage peaks on weekends.
3.	Cyclistic experiences low ridership during the winter season (November to February).

## Recommendation & Summary

1.	Offer incentives for long-duration member rides: Encourage casual riders to become members by providing benefits for longer rides.
2.	Focus marketing campaigns on weekends: Target casual riders with promotions and campaigns during peak usage times.
3.	Explore seasonal promotions: Implement strategies to attract riders during off-peak months (November to February).
